_We just need a nice intro here I guess._

#### Prioritize Hydration

The key to flawless and long-lasting makeup lies in well-hydrated skin which starts from within. I recommend a consistent effort to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily for approximately 2 months leading up to your wedding day. Additionally, establish a robust skincare routine several weeks in advance, incorporating exfoliation, serums and moisturizers. An ideal daily regimen could include vitamin C, retinol, a decent moisturizer, and SPF 50. Please refrain from introducing new products too close to your wedding date to avoid any potential skin sensitivities.

#### Beneficial Skin Treatments

I highly recommend scheduling a few facial treatments prior to your wedding day. Hydrafacials enhance your skin's moisture levels, resulting in a radiant complexion. Dermaplaning is another effective option as it exfoliates the skin and removes peach fuzz, providing the perfect canvas for long-lasting makeup (this can also be done at home, at least 3-4 days before the day). Ensure you allocate adequate time for recovery if opting for any invasive skincare treatments.

#### Spray Tans & Lash Extensions

A subtle spray tan can add a bridal glow from head to toe. However, it's best to avoid spraying your face, as the pigments in spray tan solutions can sometimes create a greenish undertone and dry out the skin. Instead, opt for a tan serum or oil formulated for the face. If you plan to apply a tan for your big day, try doing so before your bridal trial so I know what tones to work with. Lash extensions are best avoided. They can be tricky to work around and appear ashy due to eyeshadow fallout.

#### Effective Scheduling

Creating a schedule for hair and makeup on your wedding day is a good idea. Ensure you have printed or digital copies of the schedule available for everyone involved and ideally share in advance. Designate a trusted bridesmaid as the point person for the day so you can focus on yourself. A space that offers ample natural light that is close to a window is ideal. Both makeup and hair will require table space for their equipment, and hairstylists will need access to electrical outlets. For makeup, allocate 1 hour per face. This allows me some flexibility for necessary breaks and a station reset. It's important that anyone receiving makeup services arrives with a clean, makeup-free face and wears clothing that is easy to remove without disturbing the makeup. As for hair, consult your stylist for specific timing requirements. Typically, having hair styled before makeup application is best.

#### Touch-ups

Touch-ups are something that you and your bridal party might have to do at some point during the event. While I use long-wearing professional products for all my makeup applications, talking, eating, heat and sweating can impact the wear of makeup, especially lip products. I provide a touch-up kit for the bride, and it's a good idea for a bridesmaid to have a sheer compact powder for shine reduction and a nude lipstick or gloss on hand for anyone who might need to freshen up.
