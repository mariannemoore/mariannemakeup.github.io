- Hello there. Iâ€™m Marianne, a makeup artist with a passion for creating timeless, radiant looks for real women. 
  Doing makeup is my absolute favourite thing in the world, it brings me so much joy to be creative and express myself through the artistry I have worked hard to perfect. I love creating a warm connection with the people who sit in my chair and uncovering their unique perspective on beauty, so that the end result is a perfect blend of the client's vision and my expertise. 

- I have over 16 years of industry experience gained through a global perspective. From my 
  training in my hometown in Johannesburg, South Africa, to my work on film and commercial shoots in Dubai, and my tenure at MAC Cosmetics in the UK as a Trainer, I've had the privilege of honing my craft in diverse settings. Along the way, I've had incredible opportunities, including working backstage at London Fashion Weeks, doing makeup for celebrity events, and travelling the world with MAC.

- My approach to makeup artistry is centred around the individual. I absolutely love my craft and the 
  endless looks I can create, but my utmost priority is to make people feel incredible. Whether you want a natural look that subtly enhances your features or a glamorous transformation that elevates your style, I can bring any makeup wish to life. I love creating luminous, glowing skin and dimensional looks that harmonize flawlessly with every element of your personal style. Embracing the belief that makeup is an inclusive art form, I am skilled in working with all skin types and tones.
