    I am getting married in Italy this summer and really wanted to learn how to do my own soft glam for my big day. Marianne made me feel instantly comfortable the moment I met her. She was very detailed oriented with making sure I had all the necessary tools to be successful on my wedding day. She filmed the whole makeup lesson and created a detailed PDF document that I could refer to if I forgot the order of steps and a visual graph on where to place the makeup on my face. Since our appointment I have practiced my makeup routine and I have now implemented this into my own routine. My skin has never looked better & I am getting so manly lovely compliments on my complexion & makeup. Thank you Marianne! You're the best :)

    I had an in person makeup lesson and I can’t get over my natural glowy look! Marianne worked with the products I had, filled in gaps with hers, and made recommendations accordingly. She demonstrated techniques on one side of my face and I’d practice on the other. The end result is everything I hoped for, and is easily incorporated into my daily routine.

    Marianne did my makeup for an event recently and I absolutely loved her work! I felt beautiful and amazing inside and out and I was so thankful she was mindful of my sensitive skin. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone who may require headshots or is attending an event or is a bride. I will be using her again and referring her to my friends without hesitation.

    Marianne was very professional and accommodating. I was very happy with my make up on my wedding day.

    Marianne is extremely kind and pleasant. She arrived for 3 separate appointments and managed to 
    complete 3 beautiful looks in exactly the amount of time allotted. She asked questions and listened 
    carefully to each person’s preferences, skincare regimens, styles, and how often they use makeup 
    themselves. From this she created 3 distinct and beautiful looks that fit each person’s preferences 
    and personality. The bride’s makeup was distinct and stunning and fit her preferences exactly. 
    She created equally stunning looks, but the bride stood out, which was exactly what was needed. I 
    would absolutely strongly recommend Marianne’s services for any event
  highlight: Distinct and stunning

    friendly, talented and super flexible. She gave great recommendations that perfectly matched the 
    vibe I was looking for and really took the time - asking questions along the way and letting me see 
    progress as she worked. I’d highly recommend her!
