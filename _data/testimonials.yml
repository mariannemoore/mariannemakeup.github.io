    Marianne was very professional and accommodating. I was very happy with my make up on my wedding day. 
    I had a trial make up to decide what I like and Marianne was so nice and helpful. Highly recommend!

    Marianne is extremely kind and pleasant. She arrived for 3 separate appointments and managed to 
    complete 3 beautiful looks in exactly the amount of time allotted. She asked questions and listened 
    carefully to each person’s preferences, skincare regimens, styles, and how often they use makeup 
    themselves. From this she created 3 distinct and beautiful looks that fit each person’s preferences 
    and personality. The bride’s makeup was distinct and stunning and fit her preferences exactly. 
    She created equally stunning looks, but the bride stood out, which was exactly what was needed. I 
    would absolutely strongly recommend Marianne’s services for any event

    Marianne was referred over to me by another makeup artist as I was seeking someone for bridal makeup 
    on a pretty short notice. I am so thankful that I found her! She is extremely talented and also vey 
    friendly and personable which made getting ready on my big day so much more fun. I would highly 
    recommend Marianne if you are looking for a long lasting look for your wedding day or any special 
    occasion/event.

    Marianne did my makeup for a maternity shoot and everything about the experience was lovely! She’s    
    friendly, talented and super flexible. She gave great recommendations that perfectly matched the 
    vibe I was looking for and really took the time - asking questions along the way and letting me see 
    progress as she worked. I’d highly recommend her!

    Marianne was such a pleasure to work with. She easily understood my style and I felt so 
    confident after my trial with her. I loved my wedding makeup! And it stayed on the 
    entire day despite the humid weather. I didn’t want to take it off at the end of the day.

    Marianne did a fabulous job on my makeup. She was thorough, knowledgeable, talented, 
    funny and very kind. She put me at ease from the moment I met her. She listened to 
    what I wanted and made wonderful suggestions. I am so happy that I went with her for my 
    wedding day makeup. I had a number of compliments when my fiancé and I were walking 
    downtown and eating after our shoot about how fab I looked!
