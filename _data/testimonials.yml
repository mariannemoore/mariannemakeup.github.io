    Marianne was such a pleasure to work with. She easily understood my style and I felt so 
    confident after my trial with her. I loved my wedding makeup! And it stayed on the 
    entire day despite the humid weather. I didn't want to take it off at the end of the day.

    Marianne did a fabulous job on my makeup. She was thorough, knowledgeable, talented, 
    funny and very kind. She put me at ease from the moment I met her. She listened to 
    what I wanted and made wonderful suggestions. I am so happy that I went with her for my 
    wedding day makeup. I had a number of compliments when my fianc√© and I were walking 
    downtown and eating after our shoot about how fab I looked!
