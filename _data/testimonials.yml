    Marianne did my makeup for an event recently and I absolutely loved her work! I felt beautiful and amazing inside and out and I was so thankful she was mindful of my sensitive skin. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone who may require headshots or is attending an event or is a bride. I will be using her again and referring her to my friends without hesitation.
  highlight: I felt beatuiful

    Marianne was very professional and accommodating. I was very happy with my make up on my wedding day. 
    I had a trial make up to decide what I like and Marianne was so nice and helpful. Highly recommend!

    Marianne is extremely kind and pleasant. She arrived for 3 separate appointments and managed to 
    complete 3 beautiful looks in exactly the amount of time allotted. She asked questions and listened 
    carefully to each person’s preferences, skincare regimens, styles, and how often they use makeup 
    themselves. From this she created 3 distinct and beautiful looks that fit each person’s preferences 
    and personality. The bride’s makeup was distinct and stunning and fit her preferences exactly. 
    She created equally stunning looks, but the bride stood out, which was exactly what was needed. I 
    would absolutely strongly recommend Marianne’s services for any event
  highlight: Distinct and stunning

    Marianne was referred over to me by another makeup artist as I was seeking someone for bridal makeup 
    on a pretty short notice. I am so thankful that I found her! She is extremely talented and also vey 
    friendly and personable which made getting ready on my big day so much more fun. I would highly 
    recommend Marianne if you are looking for a long lasting look for your wedding day or any special 
    occasion/event.
  highlight: So much fun

    Marianne did my makeup for a maternity shoot and everything about the experience was lovely! She’s    
    friendly, talented and super flexible. She gave great recommendations that perfectly matched the 
    vibe I was looking for and really took the time - asking questions along the way and letting me see 
    progress as she worked. I’d highly recommend her!
