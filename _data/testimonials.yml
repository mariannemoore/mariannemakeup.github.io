    Marianne did my makeup for my September 2024 wedding and she was an absolute pleasure to work with right from the beginning! Before we booked a trial we had a phone call to make sure we would be a good fit and she remembered details from that phone call during our trial. During the trial she seemed to know exactly how to make me feel my most beautiful. On our wedding day I felt like an absolute princess and my makeup lasted all night but she gave me a little kit of touch up stuff just in case it didn’t.

    Marianne was such an amazing wedding makeup artist! She has such a bright and lovely personality, so understanding, and easy to get along with. Her attention to detail, ability to effortlessly highlight the best features, giving a glowing and natural look, and efficiency are a few of the amazing things Marianne has done. I loved the look she did for me and others in my bridal party. I’d highly recommend her for wedding makeup.

    Working with Marianne was a dream! I am so glad I came across her work. She did mine and my mother’s makeup for my wedding. I had a specific reference idea for my look and Marianne made it perfect for me. My mother and I did a makeup trial prior, which was great because we could map out exactly what our looks would be, and it gave us a chance to get to know Marianne and how she works. Just chatting with Marianne and getting to experience how lovely she is, in addition to having our make up incredibly done, was such a treat! The trial also meant that I could feel much more calm the day of wedding knowing exactly what Marianne would be doing. My mother and I both felt so beautiful the day of! I also learned a lot of make-up tips from this experience that I have incorporated into my own routine. I can't recommend Marianne enough for bridal or any other make-up needs!

    I’d give Maz five hundred stars if I could! Not only does she have an impressive resumé, incredible talent, and immaculate attention to detail as a makeup artist, she’s also a total joy to spend time with. I booked Marianne for our intimate island wedding earlier this month; by the end of our time together, I came away with a flawless face and a forever friend. If you’re visiting her in-home studio, you can expect a clean, comfortable, and inviting atmosphere. She’s the real deal!

    I am getting married in Italy this summer and really wanted to learn how to do my own soft glam for my big day. Marianne made me feel instantly comfortable the moment I met her. She was very detailed oriented with making sure I had all the necessary tools to be successful on my wedding day. She filmed the whole makeup lesson and created a detailed PDF document that I could refer to if I forgot the order of steps and a visual graph on where to place the makeup on my face. Since our appointment I have practiced my makeup routine and I have now implemented this into my own routine. My skin has never looked better & I am getting so manly lovely compliments on my complexion & makeup. Thank you Marianne! You're the best :)

    I had an in person makeup lesson and I can’t get over my natural glowy look! Marianne worked with the products I had, filled in gaps with hers, and made recommendations accordingly. She demonstrated techniques on one side of my face and I’d practice on the other. The end result is everything I hoped for, and is easily incorporated into my daily routine.

    Marianne did my makeup for an event recently and I absolutely loved her work! I felt beautiful and amazing inside and out and I was so thankful she was mindful of my sensitive skin. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone who may require headshots or is attending an event or is a bride. I will be using her again and referring her to my friends without hesitation.

    Marianne is extremely kind and pleasant. She arrived for 3 separate appointments and managed to 
    complete 3 beautiful looks in exactly the amount of time allotted. She asked questions and listened 
    carefully to each person’s preferences, skincare regimens, styles, and how often they use makeup 
    themselves. From this she created 3 distinct and beautiful looks that fit each person’s preferences 
    and personality. The bride’s makeup was distinct and stunning and fit her preferences exactly. 
    She created equally stunning looks, but the bride stood out, which was exactly what was needed. I 
    would absolutely strongly recommend Marianne’s services for any event
  highlight: Distinct and stunning
