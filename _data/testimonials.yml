    I had booked another makeup artist for my wedding last year, but when I stumbled upon One Fine Beauty I 
    knew I wanted to book them! I was booked with one of the senior artists, Marianne, and she was such a 
    pleasure to work with. She easily understood my style and I felt so confident after my trial with her. The 
    morning of my wedding day, I was a little sleep deprived and I asked if it was alright if I closed my 
    eyes while she did my makeup. She said "Of course", and when she was done, I opened my eyes, looked in 
    the mirror and couldn't help but smile. I loved my makeup!! And it stayed on the entire day despite the 
    humid weather. I didn't want to take it off at the end of the day. My bridesmaids also got their makeup 
    done by Marianne and Leigh-Anne and they all looked beautiful! Thank you One Fine Beauty!

    I just wanted to send you a message to tell you what a lovely person Marianne was and she did a fabulous job on my 
    makeup. She was thorough, knowledgeable, talented, funny and very kind. She put me at ease from the moment I met 
    her. She listened to what I wanted and made wonderful suggestions. I am so happy that I went with her for my 
    Wedding day makeup. My Mom was also in the room with us and she thought Marianne was just perfect and she 
    can't wait either for October 14th to have her makeup done. I definitely know I am in good hands. I had my 
    photo shoot later on Sunday evening so I am excited to see how those pics turned out. I had a number of 
    compliments when my fianc√© and I were walking downtown and eating after our shoot about how fab I 
    looked and I know that was the makeup that Marianne did. She is a gem
