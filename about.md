    <p class="standout-text"> I'm a makeup artist with over 16 years of industry experience. From my training in my hometown in Johannesburg, South Africa, to my work on film and commercial shoots in Dubai, and my tenure at MAC Cosmetics in the UK as a Trainer, I've had the privilege of honing my craft in diverse settings. Along the way, I've had incredible opportunities, including working backstage at London Fashion Weeks, doing makeup for celebrity events, and travelling the world with MAC.</p>

    <p>In 2017, life took another turn, leading me to Ottawa, where I embarked on a career in the tech industry. However, my passion for makeup will always be a part of me, and I continued to pursue freelance work by joining forces with Shannon Ranger on the One Fine Beauty team as a Senior Artist specializing in bridal makeup. In 2020 I had my first child and the world turned upside down. We re-evaluated what our family needed, and decided to make our final move to Victoria in June 2022. We had our second child not long after, and we feel so feel so lucky to call this beautiful island home.</p>

    <p>My approach to makeup artistry is centred around the individual. I absolutely love my craft and the endless looks I can create, but my utmost priority is to make people feel incredible. Whether you want a natural look that subtly enhances your features or a glamorous transformation that elevates your style, I can bring any makeup wish to life. I creating luminous, glowing skin and dimensional looks that harmonize flawlessly with every element of your personal style, from your outfit to your hair, shoes, and jewelry. Embracing the belief that makeup is an inclusive art form, I am skilled in working with all skin types and tones.</p>

    <p>For brides, my priority is ensuring you have a seamless experience from first contact through to final look. Through collaboration and a trial held at my studio in Gordon Head, we will discover and refine your dream makeup look. On your special day, I will travel to your location, leaving you with a touch-up kit to maintain a flawless appearance throughout the day and night. I use long-wearing luxury products, including MAC, Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, Charlotte Tilbury, and Hourglass Cosmetics, among others.</p>

    <p>I would be honoured to join you on your transformative beauty journey. Please don't hesitate to reach out, and together, we can make your makeup dreams a reality.</p>
